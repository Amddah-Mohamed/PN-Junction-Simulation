# PN Junction Simulation - Finite Difference Method

A MATLAB implementation for simulating current flow in a p-n diode using finite difference methods.

## üìñ Project Description

This project numerically solves the self-consistent system of equations governing the behavior of a p-n junction diode. It implements finite difference methods to calculate:

- Electric potential distribution V(x)
- Carrier concentrations n(x) and p(x)  
- Charge density œÅ(x)
- Current density J(x)
- I-V characteristics of the diode

The simulation handles both equilibrium conditions and applied biases (forward and reverse), providing insights into semiconductor device physics beyond simplified analytical models.

## üßÆ Physical Models

The implementation solves the following key equations:

- **Poisson's Equation**: ŒîV = -œÅ(x)/Œµ‚Çõ
- **Carrier Statistics**: n(x) = n‚ÇÄexp(qV/k‚ÇöT), p(x) = p‚ÇÄexp(-qV/k‚ÇöT)
- **Charge Density**: œÅ(x) = p(x) + n(x) + N_D - N_A
- **Drift-Diffusion Currents**: Includes both electron and hole contributions
- **Continuity Equation**: div(j‚Çô + j‚Çö) = 0 (stationary state)
